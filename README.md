# AI

Coded in Java (Because I don't know how to code in anything else that would enable me to do potentially complex instructions)

About the project

An attempt in creating an AI that will be able to think for its self and make decisions using the following items.

- Good/Bad
The AI code will use a dictionary to determine whether a action is good or bad in the human world. If the AI chooses to mark good items as bad and bad items as good then it will for example see that murdering people is good and other situations. However the AI can be convinced that those items are bad by the manual user input (talking to the AI) and consequences such as prison/warnings and other things.

- Trauma System
The AI code will take in the backstory or basic background information of the location of the AI as if it were a living being. Every evolution (year) until its 18th birthday will enable the trauma system at max value, 

- User inputs
The AI code will allow for text inputs of the user. The AI will run the string of text and check each word for important items, such as verbs, subjects and many other componenets in an English sentence.

Exmaple:
If you write "You are ugly", the AI will check the status of the self-esteem and confidence levels before determining a positive or negative outcome that reflect the AI themselves.

At times the AI will actually not say anything as some things may not require a response and instead the AI will change its face on the print system from a happy face to a sade face or something of that similatiry depending on the severity on how hard the insult had hurt the AI.

Output: *Sad face

- Status
The AI will have a status for everything, from financial status to the quality of life, relationships and many more.

- Personality Calculations
Depending on the locaiton, the current situation of the AI such as their relationship with parents, friends and family as well as their financial and many other. The AI will form shape with

- Word Processing
The AI will then respond everytime to situations based on their personality and current view on the world with a standard wording format.
At this current moment, the AI will only speak English due to differenting speech patterns/structures in different languages that I am currently not familiar with.

Things that need major work on:
- Statistics on geographical places that consists of crime rates, number of siblings, parental divorce chances and many, many more. These will help in developing the environment for the AI and will shape them.
- A text file with all the words in the English dictionary with their definitions. When creating the personality and other things, the AI will search up that specific word and then analyse the definition to see if it means something good or not and if an action, what that action is, example is Hiking.
